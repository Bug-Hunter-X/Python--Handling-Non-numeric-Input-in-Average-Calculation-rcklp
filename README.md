This repository demonstrates a common Python error: a `TypeError` occurring when calculating the average of a list containing non-numeric elements. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version that robustly handles various input scenarios, including empty lists and lists with mixed data types. The solution ensures the program gracefully handles these cases without crashing.
